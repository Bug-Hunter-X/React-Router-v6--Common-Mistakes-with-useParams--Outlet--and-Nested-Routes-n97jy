In React Router Dom v6, a common mistake is incorrectly using the `useParams` hook or the `Outlet` component, especially when dealing with nested routes.  For example, forgetting to wrap dynamic segments in curly braces `{}` within the `path` prop of a `Route` element can lead to unexpected behavior.  Also, improper usage of the `Outlet` component in parent routes when building nested structures can cause children routes to not render correctly.  Another issue is incorrect nesting of routes, causing rendering issues or infinite loops.
